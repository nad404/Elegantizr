#Elegantizr - micro html/css framework 
===========================================
Its a micro grid system. Yes! I got the name from <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/elegantizr/">Elegantizr</a> Google spoof [April 1st 2012]. This grid system inspired from grid 960 & bootstrap. Its not a responsive framework. It works like 960gs. Elegantizr only contains grid and reset/normalize styles are not included. It is lot less lighter than other grid systems. It is easier to learn and maintain. 

##Benefits
-------------------------
* Simple & slim 
* Easy to lean - 3 classes .container12, .row, .grid[1,2,3...12]
* Size is less than 750B [min version]
* Load time is less than 840ms. When gziped loads even faster.

##How to use
