Elegantizr - micro html/css framework 
=====================================
Its a micro grid system. Yes! I got the name from <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/elegantizr/">Elegantizr</a> Google spoof [April 1st 2012]. This grid system inspired from grid 960 & bootstrap. Its not a responsive framework. It works like 960gs. Elegantizr only contains grid and reset/normalize styles are not included. It is lot lighter than other grid systems. It is easier to learn and maintain. 

Benefits
--------
* Simple & slim 
* Supports grid 12, 16 & 24
