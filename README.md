Elegantizr - micro html/css framework 
=====================================
It is a micro grid system. Yes! I got the name from <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/elegantizr/">Elegantizr</a> Google spoof [April 1st 2012]. This grid system is inspired from grid 960 & bootstrap. Its not a responsive framework. It works like 960gs and supports 12,16 & 24 gs. Elegantizr only contains grid and no reset/normalize styles included. It is lighter than other grid systems (>750B minified and if gziped >350B). It is easier to learn and maintain. 

Benefits
--------
* Simple & slim 
* Supports grid 12, 16 & 24.
* Easy to lean - 3 classes .container#[12,16,24], .row, .grid[1,2,3...12]
* Size is less than 750B [min version]
* Load time is less than 840ms. When gziped loads even faster.
